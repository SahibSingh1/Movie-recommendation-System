# Movie-recommendor
This program uses content based filtering algorithm to recommend you 10 most relatable movies based on your input.I used TMDB dataset of movies containing different features including 'title', 'genre', 'overview', 'cast' & 'crew' etc then added a new feature 'tags' using basic NLP.
Then by using bag of words pipeline created the whole model.
